Twitter Sentiment Analysis using R

Social media sites and microblogging platforms such as Twitter have become instrumental in providing a stage for consumers to express views and opinions, post feedback,
and share their experiences about various products, services and organizations, in general. As a result, it has generated an enormous amount of data for mining opinion and sentiments for
marketing studies and for product or service improvements by organizations.

This study particularly aims at using text mining techniques to analyze the positive and negative tweets of six major US airlines and examine any possible correlations between
negative sentiments expressed by the users to draw inferences about customer perception of performance and service levels.

The dataset used in the study comes from Kaggle which is a slight variation of the original source (Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library) comprised of Twitter data scrapped
from February 2015 and classified into positive, negative and neutral tweets, followed by categorization of negative reasons.

The methodology used in this study is as follows:<br/>
1.) preprocessing of tweet data <br/>
2.) Convert text into tidy format using tokenization <br/>
3.) Generate word frequencies from tidy text format & visualizations of summarized text <br/>
4.) Test hypothesis using Pearson Product-Moment Correlation (PPMC)

The study does show evidence that customer service seems to be the single major issue across the commercial airlines industry from the customerâ€™s perspective along with schedule
adherence that includes on-time arrivals departures as well as delays and cancellations.
